## Context


Our project involves the development of a mobile and desktop application tailored for both students and professors. Our application aims to be able to connect with students and teachers throughout the school, regardless of the devices being used. Critical requirement must be considered 
	**1.Support for both iOS and Android platforms**
		The application will need to be able provide a consistent user experience across all platforms. Mobile devices varies between androids and iOS or laptops to phones. The application would need to be able to present the same data. 
	**Performance optimization for various devices**
	

## Decision

A hybrid application is essentially a web application packaged into a native application shell. This means that it is developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it runs inside a native application shell that is installed on the user's device and provides access to native device features and capabilities. When a user downloads the app from an app store, the shell connects to the mobile platform's abilities via a browser that is embedded with the app.
		**1.Support for both iOS and Android platforms**
			The hybrid application provides a single code base program that would work on all devices. This means the code is developed once per app rather than one for each platform, which can save development time and effort

## Consequences

In conclusion, the use of a hybrid application as an app type will accomplish the objectives by being able to support the application on any platform or devices. Using a single base code the hybrid app type has the ability to provide a consistent user experience across all platforms. The decision to use a Hybrid application comes with the following consequences: 
	**1.Ease of Maintenance and Updates**
		Hybrid apps are easier to maintain and update. Any modifications made to the codebase are instantly reflected across all platforms, ensuring consistent user experiences and allowing for quick bug fixes and feature enhancements
		**2.Performance Optimization**
			The performance of the hybrid app can be affected through factors such as framework or quality of code.
		 **3.User Interface Design**
			 When designing the user interface, a developer has to create a responsive user interface that works well across a range of screen sizes, orientations, resolutions, and devices.
